# ethereum-mint-bot
A free bot for minting NFTs on the Ethereum network


## Why:
* NFT minting is dominated by people with a technological advantage, this project aims to provide a competetive advantage for people that aren't software developers.
* This likely means network congestion will be increased, hopefully more NFT projects will respond by changing the minting process such that:
    * Minting is easier for people attempting to become part of a community/project that they are truely interested in, and not just for monetary value
    * Network congestion and lost fees due to gas are minimized
    * To be more inclusive for people that are new to crypto/NFTs
