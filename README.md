## Alternative
* Mint using etherscan and add the [flashbots relay to metamask](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/rpc/quick-start#how-to-use-flashbots-protect-rpc-in-metamask)

* This project is not being worked on at this time as improvements in the flashbots protect rpc along with not being able to use the flashbots bundle rpc in the browser have made it obsolete.
